# Elastic Swap v1 - Math Documentation

This document is created to explain the technical-mathematical terms and concepts behind ElasticSwap v1.

## Introduction

Elastic Swap is the first Automated Market Maker (AMM) to natively support tokens with elastic supply. It is heavily influenced by UniSwap's implementation and diverges from their design in the fact that the `quoteToken` in each `Exchange` can be a token with elastic or fixed supply.

The initial sheet from which the model was derived from can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bAX4x2MQWlfI3c0x6QRzlxhODL0ut1dLrqabWDc98eM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technical Terms

- `X` - The internal balance of `quoteToken`, for accounting purposes.
- `DeltaX (ΔX)` - The change in the value of `X`
- `XDash (X')` -> `X' = ΔX + X` - The new value of `X` (when there is presence of `DeltaX (ΔX)`)
- `Y` - The internal balance of `baseToken`, for accounting purposes.
- `DeltaY (ΔY)` - The change in the value of `Y`
- `YDash (Y')` -> `Y' = ΔY + Y` - The new value of `Y` (when there is presence of `DeltaY (ΔY)`
- `Alpha (α)` - The balance of `quoteToken` currently in the exchange.
- `Beta (β)` - The balance of `baseToken` currently in the exchange.
- `Omega (ω)` - `X/Y` - The ratio of the internal balance of `quoteToken` to the internal balance of `baseToken`.
- `iOmega (iω) ` - `Y/X` - The ratio of the internal balance of `baseToken` to the internal balance of `quoteToken`.
- `K` - `X*Y` - The product of the internal balance of `quoteToken` and the internal balance of `baseToken`.
- `Sigma (σ)` - `α/β` - The ratio of the balance of `quoteToken` currently in the exchange to the balance of `baseToken` currently in the exchange.
- `iSigma (iσ)` - `β/α` - The ratio of the balance of `baseToken` currently in the exchange to the balance of `quoteToken` currently in the exchange.
- `Epsilon (ε)` - `α*β` - The product of the balance of `quoteToken` currently in the exchange and the balance of `baseToken` currently in the exchange.
- `AlphaDecay (α^)` - `α-X` - The amount of `Alpha(α)` not contributing to the liquidity.
- `BetaDecay (β^)` - `β-Y` - The amount of `Beta(β)` not contributing to the liquidity.
- `Ro (ρ)` - The total supply of the `liquidityToken`.
- `Gamma (γ)` - `ΔY / Y / 2 * ( ΔX / α^' )` - Gamma is a multiplier term that is used to issue the correct amount of `liquidityToken` when `alphaDecay(α^)` or `BetaDecay (β^)` exists in the system.
  > Note: `Gamma (γ)` uses `α^' - AlphaDecayDash` which is the new `AlphaDecay(α^)`
